# Using ASP.NET for our REST API's

## Context and Problem Statement

We wanted a framework for our REST API to help handle some of the more network heavy and boiler plate code associated with creating an API. We don't have the epxertise or time to build a propriety system and there are plenty out there that meet all our needs.

## Considered Options

* ASP.NET
* Node.js

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "ASP.NET", because all developers have experience with C# and it meets all of our needs.

<!-- This is an optional element. Feel free to remove. -->
## Pros and Cons of the Options

### ASP.NET

* Good, because it uses C# which we all have experience with
* Good, because it doesn't require much to set up an API
* Good, because it's well documented online
* Good, because it's supported by microsoft
* Bad, because it can use more resources than Node.js

### Node.js

* Good, because it uses javascript which has been used by all of us
* Good, because it has an active community
* Bad, because it doesn't always have backward compatability
* Bad, because it uses an event driven architecture which we're unfamiliar with
