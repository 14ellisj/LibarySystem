# Use Vue.js for frontend framework

## Context and Problem Statement
How can we quickly create a prototype for our library application that allows us to work together effectively. 

## Considered Options

* React
* Vue.js
* Angular

## Decision Outcome

Chosen Option: "Vue.js", because see pros and cons below.

### Consequences

* Good, because we can quickly start our project and work around one another easily
* Bad, because the small size of it may limit it's scalability, encouraging us to change frameworks after prototyping

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Vue.js

[Pros and Cons](https://www.altexsoft.com/blog/pros-and-cons-of-vue-js/)

* Good, because handles lots of boiler plate code
* Good, because relatively simple to learn
* Good, because it's modular so easy to work around others
* Good, because modular design reduces code duplication
* Bad, because a lot of it's use is in china and there's a language barrier in some online forums
* Bad, because the team is relatively small so there may be more problems and slower to fix

### React
[Pros and Cons](https://medium.com/@reactmasters.in/advantages-and-disadvantages-of-react-js-e6c80b25763b)

* Good, because modular
* Good, because scalable
* Bad, because steep learning curve
* Bad, because quite large

### Angular
[Pros and Cons](https://leobit.com/blog/why-to-use-angular-in-an-overview-of-angular-pros-and-cons/)

* Good, because modular
* Good, because scalable
* Good, because regular updates
* Good, because generally backward compatability
* Bad, because steep learning curve
* Bad, because community disagreement
* Bad, because lots of boiler plate code
